When you use HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider as identity provider in OpenShift, then there are some of the things that you should keep in mind when creating or deleting user:

1. If you are using HA OpenShift cluster then replicate htpasswd file on all the master instances.
2. If you are deleting a user using htpasswd utility then also delete the user in OpenShift cluster using below commands:

	oc delete user <username>

3. Above command will not delete user identity and it should be explicitly deleted so that when again a user is created with same username then its UID will not conflict.

	To get the identity:
	
	oc get identites
	
	Look the deleted user identity and delete with below command:
	
	oc delete identity <identity_name>
