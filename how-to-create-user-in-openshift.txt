If identity provider is HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider, then follow below steps:

Run all below commands on master1 node of OpenShift using root account

To create a flat file with a user name and hashed password, run:
	
	$ htpasswd -c /etc/origin/master/htpasswd <user_name>
	
Then, enter and confirm a clear-text password for the user. The command generates a hashed version of the password.

For example:

	htpasswd -c /etc/origin/master/htpasswd user1
	New password:
	Re-type new password:
	Adding password for user user1
	
	
You can include the -b option to supply the password on the command line:

	$ htpasswd -c -b file user1 MyPassword!
	Adding password for user user1

Once user is created, then restart api and controller using below command:

	$ master-restart api
	$ master-restart controllers
	
If you get error that master-restart command not found, then run below commands:

	$ /usr/local/bin/master-restart api
	$ /usr/local/bin/master-restart controllers
